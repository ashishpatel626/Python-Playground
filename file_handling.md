A Whisper of Time

Beneath the vault of starlit skies,
Where shadows dance and moonlight sighs,
A whisper weaves through ancient trees,
A tale of time on fleeting breeze.

The river hums its endless song,
Through valleys deep, it rolls along,
Each ripple holds a moment's grace,
A fleeting glimpse of time's embrace.

The mountains stand, unyielding, still,
Their silent watch o'er dale and hill,
Yet even stone, in time's soft hand,
Will crumble into grains of sand.

O mortal heart, so brief, so bright,
You burn with dreams against the night,
Each beat a note in life's grand rhyme,
A fragile verse within its time.

So pause, dear soul, and softly tread,
Where stars and earth and dreams are wed,
For time, a whisper, gently flows,
Through all we love, and all we know.
